AirVille is set at the check-in counters in an airport. 
The player manages the counters and airline agents who 
are responsible for checking in passengers into flights. 
The player will get points and rewards as he checks in 
passengers. Faster progress in the game depends on the 
efficiency of the check-in process (and on how much help 
the player is willing to buy from the game store).
